experiment with simple image clustering in python
eg
python clusterimages -show testimages
	  ..to immediately show results

python clusterimages testimages > output.json
	.. to dump the clustered image filenames as JSON data (nested arrays):-

doesn't yet emit the cluster centres, they are the centroids of the contained data ('blur them all together') but they're shown in immiediate mode
